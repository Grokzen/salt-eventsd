#### salt-eventsd installation ####
###################################

last update: Aug 10th, 2013

the daemon requires a very bleeding (as of today, aug 10th, 2013) edge salt 
version that does a 'new_job' event for every job that is published.

check your salt-masters version, 0.16.2 should have that event (i think).

to be sure, check this commit against your salt-master source.
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/6551

verified? good!

installation is simple for the currently supported mysql-backend. other backends
will follow, for now only mysql is supported.

1. install mysql and create a database, name does not matter, just remember it.
2. import the supplied mysql-dump from /usr/share/doc/salt-eventsd/ into your 
   database. it will create two tables:
    
      command: thats where all published commands go
      results: thats where all the replies go

3. put the also supplied eventsd configuration from /usr/share/doc/salt-eventsd/
   into /etc/salt/, update it with your mysql-credentials and your good to go.

4. restart the daemon with its init-skript and the data should start coming in.
   with the default config that should be the published commands and the matching
   returns.

feel free to configure the daemon for other events if desired.


#### debugging ####
###################
1. set the debugging level in config to 'debug' and restart the daemon. the logfile
   in /var/log/salt/ will (hopefully) tell you whats going wrong.

2. if the daemon does not respond anymore, you're free to kill it with 'kill -9 <pid'.
   if thats necessary, start the daemon on the command line with:

       $ salt-eventsd fg

   and redo what you did before. If there is an exception, it will be printed to the
   console where the daemon is running in the foreground. I'd appreciate it, if you
   would open an issue for that and supply the backtrace. THANK YOU!
